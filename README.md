# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect Use of $inc Operator
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$inc` operator within a MongoDB aggregation pipeline.  The example shows an attempt to increment the sum of values after the `$group` stage which is incorrect. The correct approach is to handle the increment within the `$group` stage itself.

## Problem
The provided code attempts to use the `$inc` operator outside of a proper context, leading to an error. The `$inc` operator should be used within a stage that modifies documents, such as `$group`, `$addFields`, or `$project`, and it operates on a field within a document. This is not correctly implemented here.

## Solution
The solution involves integrating the increment directly into the `$group` stage. This modifies the accumulated sum during the grouping process itself, rather than trying to increment after the grouping is complete.
